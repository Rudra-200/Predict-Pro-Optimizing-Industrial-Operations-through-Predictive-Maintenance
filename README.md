## Introduction
Predictive maintenance is a technique used in various industries to predict equipment failures before they occur. By analyzing historical data from sensors, patterns that precede equipment failures can be identified, enabling proactive maintenance strategies. This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs.

## Problem Statement
In manufacturing industries, unexpected equipment failures lead to significant downtimes and increased operational costs. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance model using historical sensor data. By identifying patterns that precede equipment failures, the system should enable proactive maintenance, reducing unplanned downtime and maintenance expenses.
